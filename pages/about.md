# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
Astronomy PhD. candidate at university of Chile. Looking for exoworlds by observing the spectra of stars. I do most, if not all, of my science with Python.
I'm also very much into photography, especially nature photography, landscapes and such.
